### Hi, I'm Benja 👋

I'm a 20 year old guy from Oslo, Norway striving to innovate great solutions to modern-day problems. I specialize in digital design and development, but any activity requiring problem solving and creative thinking is where you will find me.

Currently working full-time as a Software Engineer @ <a href="https://finn.no/">Finn</a>, while maintaining previous client's (startups and established companies) websites through my sole proprietorship and working on personal projects in my spare time.
