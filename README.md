### Hi, I'm Benja 👋

I'm a 19 year old guy from 🇳🇴 Oslo, Norway striving to innovate great solutions to modern-day problems. I specialize in digital design and development, but any activity requiring problem solving and creative thinking is where you will find me.

Currently working full-time as a Frontend Engineer and Designer @ <a href="https://notify.me/">Notify Technology, Inc.</a>, while maintaining previous clients's (startups and established companies) websites through my sole proprietorship and working on personal projects in my spare time.

~ I wish I did more open source work, and I'll try my best to get more into it in the near future.
